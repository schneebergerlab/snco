Welcome to coelsch's documentation!

coelsch: Single Nucleus Crossover Analysis
---------------------------------------

coelsch is a set of tools for identifying recombination events at the single nucleus/cell level, using read alignments and/or SNP data from single nucleus sequencing experiments of recombinant haploid gametes. Reads alignments or SNPs are summarised into a per-cell barcode "marker" dataset which can then be used to perform crossover analysis with a hidden Markov model. coelsch also provides commands for generating per-barcode summary statistics, plotting marker and crossover profiles, and simulating ground truth datasets using marker distributions from real data.

coelsch is still under active development, so expect some bugs and changes! If in doubt about the behaviour of coelsch or how it might change, feel free to reach out by opening an issue on GitHub!

sneqtl: Single Nucleus Expression QTL Analysis
----------------------------------------------

coelsch also ships with sneqtl, a submodule for performing expression QTL analyses on single gamete sequencing datasets using the haplotypes generated by coelsch. This is currently still under development.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install coelsch is using the conda yaml provided:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/schneebergerlab/coelsch.git
    cd coelsch
    conda env create -f coelsch.yaml

alternatively, you can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/schneebergerlab/coelsch.git

coelsch requires torch and pomegranate>=1.0 for performing crossover detection, pysam and joblib for bam file manipulation and numpy, pandas, scipy and matplotlib for general marker analysis and plotting. The command line interface is build using click. For sneqtl and some of the provided helper scripts, scikit-learn and parasail are also required.

Quickstart
----------

coelsch divides the analysis into several subcommands for modular and flexible workflows. There are currently two different methods provided for loading markers into the format used for crossover prediction. These are: 

* coelsch loadbam: read a bam file aligned with cell barcode and haplotype alignment tags. Currently the best way to generate this is to run STAR solo in Diploid alignment mode. This is a mode of STAR where reads can be aligned to two different haploid genomes at once. See the [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) and detailed coelsch loadbam documentation (coming soon) for further information.
* coelsch loadcsl: read a matrix market + vcf file describing biallelic SNP counts for individual cells, generated by [cellsnp-lite](https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite). The reference allele is assumed to derive from haplotype 1, and the alternative allele from haplotype 2.

The output of both load commands is a json file containing marker information, which can be fed into the downstream clean, predict, stats and plot commands.

If you would like to perform the full analysis in a single step, then the core analysis pipeline, load(+clean)+predict, can be run together as a single command using coelsch bam2pred or coelsch csl2pred.

Python API
----------

coelsch also provides an API with some helpful classes for working with output marker and predictions datasets in python. These are the MarkerRecords and PredictionRecords classes:

.. code-block:: python

    from coelsch import MarkerRecords, PredictionRecords
    
    co_markers = MarkerRecords.read_json('markers.json')
    co_preds = PredictionRecords.read_json('pred.json')
    
    co_markers.barcodes[:5]
    
        ['TGGTTAGGTAGATTGA',
         'ACGTAGTTCATCAGTG',
         'GACCAATCAACAAAGT',
         'CTATAGGGTTACCTTT',
         'AGAGAATCAGACAATA']
    

Plotting functions can also accessed both from the command line using coelsch plot and also in python using the coelsch.plot module or built in methods of MarkerRecords/PredictionRecords


.. code-block:: python

    co_markers.plot_barcode('TGGTTAGGTAGATTGA', co_preds=co_preds, max_yheight=10);
